    /// by going through Player.PlacePiece so validity stays the game's problem. Keeping new
    /// features on that seam is what makes them survive a game update; a custom subclass or
    /// a patch on movement trades that away.
    ///
    /// Never guess an API. Read it, with
    /// <c>ilspycmd -t &lt;Type&gt; -r "&lt;ManagedDir&gt;" "&lt;ManagedDir&gt;\assembly_valheim.dll"</c>,
    /// or take the numbers off a devkit rip. A wrong method name is a Harmony patch that
    /// throws once at load and then quietly never runs.

        //
        //   Character.OnDeath runs on the OWNING CLIENT ONLY. Its own !IsOwner() early
        //   return is dead code, so the block above it looks like it runs everywhere and
        //   does not. Anything per-player at a kill has to be done by the owner for
        //   everybody, e.g. through Player.GetPlayersInRange.
        //
        //   SEMan.Internal_AddStatusEffect refreshes an already-running effect in place and
        //   returns without reaching the public AddStatusEffect overload. Patching only the
        //   public one misses every refresh.
        //
        //   Player.ConsumeItem removes the item whatever EatFood returned. Refuse food in
        //   CanConsumeItem, which is the gate that path respects; refusing later destroys it.
        //
        //   The first ObjectDB.Awake of a session fires against a stub with no items. Gate
        //   anything that reads the item database on m_items.Count > 0, and hook
        //   ObjectDB.CopyOtherDB as well - that is the path a client takes on joining a
        //   server.
        //
        //   Writing to a container or ZDO you do not own is silently discarded. Call
        //   nview.ClaimOwnership() first, which is what vanilla's Take All does.
